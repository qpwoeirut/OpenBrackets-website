<br>

<p>
    The Intermediate Python Game Building course is for students who have some experience with programming in
    Python.
    <b>It is highly recommended that students take the <a href="/spring2021/beginnerPython.html">Beginner Python Game
        Building</a> class before this one.</b> In order to
    be able to complete the course, students will need an internet connection, a device capable of running Zoom, and
    a computer that can access <a href="https://replit.com/" target="_blank">https://replit.com/</a>.

        <p>Week 1 Day 1 | <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qPC_wJedqRx725808C25ARikSdsGNKpyFtVEG-Isz9k/edit"
                target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
        <p>To refresh the skills learned in the Intro to Python class, students will review and practice each topic.
            The first day of the review will cover printing, libraries, variables, input, types, and conditionals.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 2: Intro to Python Review Part 2</h5>
        <p>Week 1 Day 2 | <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1BZTz0M8KpBhPq_nToJv7kJZt5_P_ryS22mW5a8gUHH4/edit"
                target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
        <p>This will be the second part of the Intro to Python review. It will cover the remaining topics, including
            loops, functions, lists, 2D lists, and dictionaries.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 3: Graphics</h5>
        <p>Week 2 Day 1 | <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fxQe-OhfXlKWFKfAeVz1-aXHVBsc8HXDf_TXTEoPpTA/edit"
                target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
        <p>Students will be introduced to the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html"
                                                 target="_blank">Turtle</a> graphics library in Python. We'll start
            by drawing basic shapes and designs using the <code>goto</code> method. Students will also learn how to
            customize their pen color and shape.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 4: Turtle Race Part 1</h5>
        <p>Week 2 Day 2 | <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fxQe-OhfXlKWFKfAeVz1-aXHVBsc8HXDf_TXTEoPpTA/edit#slide=id.gc82d571c78_0_120"
                target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
        <p>This lesson will introduce another way to draw with the <code>turtle</code> library. Then, to help
            students familiarize themselves with the Turtle Graphics library, we will build a game called Turtle
            Race. In Turtle Race, students will animate multiple turtles racing to a finish line, and then display
            the winner. This project will be finished in the next class.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 5: Turtle Race Part 2</h5>
        <p>Week 3 Day 1 | <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fxQe-OhfXlKWFKfAeVz1-aXHVBsc8HXDf_TXTEoPpTA/edit#slide=id.gc82d571c78_0_148"
                target="_blank">Slides</a></p>
        <p>Students will finish the Turtle Race game that they started in the previous lesson.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Final Project: Block Collector</h5>
        <p>Week 3 Day 2 - Week 6 | <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hIgNtLACfnG-aQq7VrQqCePrqS4ieHRUM3r0A4x6F6k/edit" target="_blank">Slides</a> </p>
        <p>Students will create a game called Block Collector. In Block Collector, a player moves a block around
            their screen and tries to collect other blocks to increase their score. Students who want an extra
            challenge can implement additional features, like game restarts, a high score, and a timer. This will be
            the capstone project for the course.
