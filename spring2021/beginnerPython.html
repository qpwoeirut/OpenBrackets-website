        <p>After students have progressed through the first 6 lessons, they will be guided through creating
            their own game: <a href="https://replit.com/talk/share/Treasure-Hunter/57676" target="_blank">Treasure
                Hunter</a>.
            In this game, players must find 3 gold nuggets on a 5 by 5 grid before their turns are up.
            This project utilizes a little bit of every lesson, and will allow students to walk away with a concrete
            game they created themselves.
