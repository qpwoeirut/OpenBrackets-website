        <h3 class="text-center">Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            At OpenBrackets, we want to help bridge the digital divide. Inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement
            in Spring/Summer 2020, we wanted to make an immediate change in our community.
            Through our courses, we provide support in computer science to middle and high school kids who
            may not receive it at home, and encourage kids to consider tech as a career, regardless of their
            background. We also provide students with the opportunity to hear from Guest Speakers in the industry,
            to see the versatility a computer science foundation can provide.
            OpenBrackets is run by students, for students.

            My son had never done any coding before and not only did he learn so much from this experience
            but enjoyed his time with you all as well.</i>"

            difficult to navigate remotely, my son was still able to get so much out of it. All your staff were
            amazing and worked so well with our children considering the circumstances. My son had never done any
            coding before and not only did he learn so much from this experience but enjoyed his time with you all

            never been able to enroll my coding enthusiast daughter in a coding program as they cost a fortune but
