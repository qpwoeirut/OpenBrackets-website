        </p>
        <p>Students will learn about lists in Python, as well as their applications. To see a real application of
            lists, as well as the methods that can be performed on lists, students will practice making grocery
            lists.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Lesson 6: 2D Lists and Dictionaries</h5>
        <p>October 30, 2020 | <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13rlfQ1F8OyM8IFx1uuLksoz5l9oyhe_Mxgj-4mi_bkY"
                target="_blank">Slides</a>
        </p>
        <p>Students will learn how 2D lists and dictionaries can be utilized in Python. By the end of
            Lesson 6, they will have a solid foundation in lists, traversing lists, and dictionaries. They will also
            try storing car data in a dictionary.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h5 class="mt-0">Final Project</h5>
        <p>November 2, 2020 | <a
                href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1A43vhgv37QHEJXEmskQa7EkYhYOKaiweU_P32HQkoaY"
                target="_blank">Slides</a>
        </p>
        <p>After students have progressed through the first 6 lessons, they will be guided through creating
            their own game: <a href="https://replit.com/talk/share/Treasure-Hunter/57676" target="_blank">Treasure
                Hunter</a>.
            In this game, players must find 3 gold nuggets on a 5 by 5 grid before their turns are up.
            This project utilizes a little bit of every lesson, and will allow students to walk away with a concrete
            game they created themselves.
